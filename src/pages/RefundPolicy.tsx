                <li>To cancel your service, log in to your client area and follow the cancellation procedure under the "My Services" section. The system will confirm your cancellation request and provide an estimated processing time.</li>
                <li>Monthly plans can be canceled at any time, but we do not provide partial refunds for unused portions of the current billing period. Your service will remain active until the end of the current paid period.</li>
                <li>For annual plans, cancellation will stop future renewals, but the service will remain active until the end of the current paid term unless otherwise specified.</li>
                <li>Cancellations must be submitted at least 24 hours before the next billing cycle to avoid being charged for the upcoming period. We recommend processing cancellations at least 48 hours in advance to ensure timely handling.</li>
                <li>Upon cancellation, it is your responsibility to back up any data from your server. All data will be permanently deleted upon service termination in accordance with our data retention policies.</li>

                <li>If you believe you have been incorrectly charged or billed, please contact our billing department within 30 days of the charge. We will investigate all legitimate billing disputes and resolve them promptly.</li>
                <li>Customers who initiate chargebacks or payment disputes through their payment provider without first attempting to resolve the issue with our billing department may have their accounts suspended or terminated.</li>
                <li>In cases of billing errors on our part, we will issue a refund or account credit as appropriate, depending on the circumstances and customer preference.</li>
                <li>For subscription billing issues, we may offer a grace period to resolve payment problems before service suspension. Contact our billing team immediately if you anticipate payment difficulties.</li>

                <li>In cases of extended service outages (exceeding 24 consecutive hours) caused by our infrastructure, we may offer service credits or partial refunds at our discretion, even outside the standard refund eligibility period.</li>
                <li>Customers experiencing financial hardship may contact our customer service team to discuss potential options for service downgrades, payment plans, or special arrangements.</li>
                <li>For customers affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events, we may extend special considerations regarding service continuity, payment deadlines, or cancellation terms. Contact our support team to discuss your situation.</li>
